# v0.301-beta - bugs fix

- A major bug disallowed the new stock calculation when Pilldroid was called in background.
This bug is now fixed, but other bugs could appears.
Thanks for your help and patience. A small word always make me happy.

# v0.300-beta - New features

- The prescription list management have been revamp (the medics your taken);
    - a swipe from right to left remove a medic from the list AND from the database;
    - a swipe from left to right allow you to change the detail of the medic, exactly has taping
    ont the right arrow.

Those change allow you to remove medics with a take to zero (0) for a to long time and you'll never
take again.
They allow me to go to the next step of Pilldroid advancement. Instead of displaying the medic named,
Pilldroid will display the molecule (doliprane, efferalgant, daflagant will be displyed has paracétamol).
I will sais more soon.

Thanks to make return of those new features, [Pilldroid](mailto:jacques+pilldroid@foucry.net)
or [Pilldroid](mailto:pilldroid@foucry.net).

# v0.201-beta - fix bug in `alarmReceiver`

The `alarmReceiver` was still using the old database that *should* be empty. I use `room` database
management now.

# v0.200-beta – New semantic version number (VRelease.MajorMinorPatch)

**REMEMBER** Pilldroid is a French people user only.

I made a lot a tests but there must stay some bugs.

## What's new

A lot of things under the surface :
- Add an alert about non responsibility of the author in case of trouble;
- Using `Room` to manage databases;
- Migration of the old database to the new one, you should not see anything;
- Code cleaning.

## What should work.
- QR-code scan on a dark background. The library have an option for that.


**WARNING**, Pilldroid does not manage creams, liquids
(like insulin).
